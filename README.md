# hello-world
A little about me

I'm graduating in Computer Science by PUCPR.

what i most enjoy doing in my area is developing web pages and architecting software, but for money I have built java applications, python A.I., web pages, the only thing i wouldn't dare to touch again is game development.

what I use most to program today is React and Python.
